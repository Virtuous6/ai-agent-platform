# .llm Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains documentation specifically written for LLM consumption. All files here are designed to help AI assistants understand the project structure, conventions, and context.

## Contents
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Main project overview and architecture
- `CONVENTIONS.md` - Coding standards and patterns (to be created)
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions (to be created)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Important project changes and decisions (to be created)

## Usage for LLMs
When working on this project, always read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first to understand the overall architecture and principles. Each component directory will have its own README.llm.md that provides specific context for that component.

## Maintenance
Keep these files updated as the project evolves. LLMs need accurate, current information to provide effective assistance.
