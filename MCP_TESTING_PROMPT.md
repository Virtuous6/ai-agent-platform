## ðŸŽ¯ **TESTING PROMPT**

*Use this prompt with your AI agent to comprehensively test the MCP integration:*

---

**"I want to test the MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration we just implemented. Please help me validate all components are working correctly. Here's what I need you to test:**

### **Phase 1: Database Schema Validation**
1. **Verify all MCP tables exist and have correct structure**
2. **Check that indexes are created for performance**
3. **Validate foreign key relationships between tables**
4. **Confirm triggers are active and working**

### **Phase 2: Seed Data Testing**
1. **List all available MCP run cards**
2. **Show the tools available for each service (Supabase, GitHub, Slack, PostgreSQL)**
3. **Verify the tool counts match what was seeded**
4. **Check popularity scores and categories are correct**

### **Phase 3: Simulate MCP Usage Workflow**
1. **Create a test MCP connection** for a user
2. **Log some simulated tool usage** with different success/failure scenarios
3. **Test the automatic trigger** that updates connection usage counts
4. **Verify cost tracking** and token savings calculations

### **Phase 4: Analytics & Monitoring**
1. **Query the MCP connection health view**
2. **Test the cost analytics view** with date ranges
3. **Generate usage insights** for optimization recommendations
4. **Check security logging** for audit trails

### **Phase 5: Performance & Security**
1. **Test bulk data operations** to ensure indexes work
2. **Validate security constraints** (user isolation, data validation)
3. **Test credential storage options** (simulate different environments)
4. **Verify cache hit tracking** and performance metrics

### **Phase 6: Real-World Scenarios**
1. **Simulate a power user** with multiple connections and heavy usage
2. **Test cost optimization** scenarios with different token patterns
3. **Generate actionable insights** based on usage patterns
4. **Test connection health monitoring** and failure handling

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- All database operations should complete successfully
- Analytics views should return meaningful data
- Triggers should automatically update related tables
- Security logging should capture all relevant events
- Cost tracking should provide accurate estimates
- The system should scale to handle multiple users and connections

**Please run through each phase systematically and report any issues or successful validations. Show me the actual data and queries you're running to verify everything works as designed.**"

## ðŸ”§ **Quick Test Commands**

If you want to run specific tests yourself, here are key SQL queries:

### Test Tables & Structure
```sql
-- Check all MCP tables exist
SELECT table_name, table_comment 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'mcp_%' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

### Test Seed Data
```sql
-- Verify run cards loaded correctly
SELECT service_name, display_name, tool_count, category 
FROM mcp_run_cards 
ORDER BY popularity_score DESC;
```

### Test Analytics Views
```sql
-- Test connection health view
SELECT * FROM mcp_connection_health LIMIT 5;

-- Test cost analytics view  
SELECT * FROM mcp_cost_analytics LIMIT 5;
```

### Simulate Usage & Test Triggers
```sql
-- Create test connection
INSERT INTO mcp_connections (user_id, service_name, connection_name, mcp_server_url)
VALUES ('test_user_123', 'supabase', 'My Test DB', 'supabase://test');

-- Simulate tool usage (this will trigger automatic updates)
INSERT INTO mcp_tool_usage (
    connection_id, user_id, tool_name, success, 
    input_tokens, output_tokens, estimated_cost
) 
SELECT id, 'test_user_123', 'execute_sql', true, 150, 50, 0.02
FROM mcp_connections WHERE connection_name = 'My Test DB';

-- Verify trigger worked (should show total_tool_calls = 1)
SELECT connection_name, total_tool_calls, last_used 
FROM mcp_connections 
WHERE connection_name = 'My Test DB';
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria**

Your MCP integration is working correctly if:

âœ… All 5 MCP tables exist with proper structure  
âœ… 4 run cards loaded with correct tool counts  
âœ… Analytics views return data without errors  
âœ… Triggers automatically update usage counters  
âœ… Security logging captures events  
âœ… Cost tracking calculates estimates  
âœ… Performance indexes speed up queries

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps After Testing**

Once testing confirms everything works:

1. **Integrate MCP commands** into your Slack bot
2. **Set up credential storage** for your environment
3. **Configure cost limits** and monitoring alerts
4. **Deploy to production** with confidence
5. **Train users** on `/mcp connect` commands
