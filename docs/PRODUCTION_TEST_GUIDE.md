# 🎯 AI Agent Platform - $2.50 Production Test Guide

## 🚀 **Ready to Test Your Complete System!**

This guide walks you through executing the comprehensive $2.50 production test that validates **every capability** of your self-improving AI agent platform.

## 💰 **What This Test Does**

**COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS GOAL:**
> Analyze a struggling e-commerce platform and create a 90-day turnaround strategy to increase revenue by 40% while reducing operational costs by 25%.

**Tests Every System Component:**
- ✅ **Goal-Oriented Orchestration** - Complex multi-step execution
- ✅ **Dynamic Agent Spawning** - 4-6 specialist agents created on-demand  
- ✅ **Human Approval Workflows** - Real approval requests for expensive operations
- ✅ **Cost Tracking & Budgets** - Real-time Supabase cost monitoring
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Technical, research, financial, strategy agents
- ✅ **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of failures
- ✅ **Pattern Recognition** - Reusable workflow creation
- ✅ **Self-Improvement** - Learning from execution

## 🔧 **Prerequisites**

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# Required - Get from your providers
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-key"
export SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"

# Optional - Test configuration
export MAX_GOAL_COST="2.50"
export COST_ALERT_THRESHOLD="2.00"  
export AUTO_STOP_AT_BUDGET="true"
```

### 2. Database Setup
Your Supabase database should have the required tables. The system will log to:
- `goals` - Goal tracking and progress
- `workflow_runs` - Execution tracking
- `spawned_agents` - Dynamic agent management
- `messages` - Token usage and costs
- `token_usage` - Detailed cost analytics

## 🎯 **Running the Test**

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the complete test with environment validation
./run_production_test.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Execution
```bash
# Set your environment variables first
python3 production_test.py
```

```bash
export SUPABASE_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"
```

**"Budget exceeded"**
- Check your current OpenAI usage
- Verify SUPABASE cost tracking
- Reduce MAX_GOAL_COST if needed

**"Database connection failed"**
- Verify SUPABASE_URL format
- Check Supabase project status
- Validate API key permissions

### Debug Mode:
```bash
# Enable detailed logging
export PYTHONPATH=.
python3 -m logging.basicConfig level=DEBUG production_test.py
```
