# Active Runbooks Directory

## Purpose
Contains production-ready runbook workflows that are currently active in the AI Agent Platform. These runbooks implement the business logic for user interactions and automated processes.

## Current Active Runbooks

### User Interaction Runbooks
- **`answer-question.yaml`** âœ… - Intelligent Q&A with web search integration
- **`welcome-new-user.yaml`** (to be created) - First-time user onboarding
- **`general-conversation.yaml`** (to be created) - Default conversation handling
- **`agent-routing.yaml`** (to be created) - Request routing to appropriate agents

### Support Runbooks
- **`technical-support.yaml`** (to be created) - Technical issue escalation
- **`error-handling.yaml`** (to be created) - System error response procedures
- **`escalation-matrix.yaml`** (to be created) - Support escalation workflows

### Research Runbooks
- **`research-request.yaml`** (to be created) - Research task coordination
- **`data-analysis.yaml`** (to be created) - Data processing workflows
- **`report-generation.yaml`** (to be created) - Report creation procedures

## Runbook Lifecycle
1. **Development**: Created from templates and tested
2. **Staging**: Validated in staging environment
3. **Production**: Deployed to this directory
4. **Monitoring**: Performance and usage tracking
5. **Retirement**: Moved to archive when replaced

## Usage Guidelines
- Only production-ready runbooks belong here
- All runbooks must include proper error handling
- Version numbers follow semantic versioning
- Include comprehensive `llm_context` for AI understanding

## Deployment Process
1. Validate runbook syntax and logic
2. Test in staging environment
3. Review with team for business logic accuracy
4. Deploy to this directory
5. Monitor performance and user feedback

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Execution frequency and success rates
- Performance metrics and bottlenecks
- User satisfaction with workflow outcomes
- Error patterns and failure points

## Version Control
- Track changes in the changelog section
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Archive old versions before deploying updates
- Document breaking changes clearly
