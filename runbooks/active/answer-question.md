# Answer Question Runbook

## Overview
The `answer-question.yaml` runbook provides intelligent question answering by combining the general agent's knowledge base with real-time web search capabilities. It creates comprehensive, accurate, and current answers to user questions.

## Workflow Process

### 1. Question Classification
- **Analyzes** the user's question to determine type and complexity
- **Categorizes** into: factual, procedural, current events, local info, or product research
- **Assesses** time sensitivity and domain knowledge requirements

### 2. Direct Answer Attempt
- **Invokes** the general agent with the question
- **Evaluates** agent confidence and completeness
- **Identifies** when additional information is needed

### 3. Intelligent Web Search
- **Triggers** when the agent indicates uncertainty or needs current data
- **Constructs** optimized search queries based on question type
- **Retrieves** relevant, credible web sources using the web search tool

### 4. Answer Synthesis
- **Combines** agent knowledge with web search results
- **Creates** comprehensive responses with proper citations
- **Ensures** accuracy and relevance

### 5. Response Formatting
- **Structures** the answer with clear sections
- **Includes** source citations and metadata
- **Adds** freshness indicators for current information

## Trigger Conditions

### Primary Triggers
- **Question patterns**: "what", "how", "why", "when", "where", "who", "?"
- **Agent mentions**: Direct references to the general agent
- **Question detection**: ML-based question identification (confidence â‰¥ 70%)

### Priority Ranking
1. **Highest**: Direct question detection
2. **Medium**: Agent mentions
3. **Lowest**: Keyword patterns

## Features

### Adaptive Intelligence
- **Confidence learning**: Improves routing decisions over time
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifies question types automatically
- **Quality assurance**: Fact-checking and bias detection

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: 30-minute TTL for repeated questions
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple search queries when needed
- **Resource management**: Controlled timeout and retry limits

### Quality Assurance
- **Source verification**: Credibility scoring for web results
- **Fact checking**: Cross-reference multiple sources
- **Bias detection**: Balanced perspective inclusion

## Configuration

### Timeouts
- **Overall workflow**: 60 seconds
- **Web search**: 30 seconds
- **Agent processing**: 20 seconds

### Retry Policy
- **Maximum retries**: 2 attempts
- **Backoff strategy**: Exponential backoff

### Caching
- **Cache TTL**: 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
- **Cache scope**: Agent responses, search results, synthesized answers

## Input Examples

### Factual Questions
```
"What is machine learning?"
"Define artificial intelligence"
"Explain quantum computing"
```

### Procedural Questions
```
"How do I deploy a Python app to AWS?"
"What are the steps to create a React component?"
"How to set up a database connection?"
```

### Current Events
```
"What's the latest news on AI regulation?"
"Current trends in cybersecurity 2025"
"Recent developments in renewable energy"
```

### Local Information
```
"Best restaurants near me"
"Python developers in San Francisco"
"Tech meetups in my area"
```

### Product Research

- [Source 2](url) - Description

ðŸ’¡ *This answer was enhanced with current web information*
```

### Metrics Tracked
- Response time
- Confidence score
- Number of sources used
- Search result count
- Synthesis quality
- User satisfaction

## Integration Requirements

### Required Components
- **General Agent** (v1.0.0+)
  - Question answering capability
  - Response synthesis
  - Citation formatting

- **Web Search Tool** (v1.0.0+)
  - Intelligent query routing
  - Result processing
  - Credibility scoring

### Optional Enhancements
- **Fact Checker Tool**: Additional verification

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
1. **Web search fails**: Use agent-only response
2. **Agent fails**: Use web search only
3. **Both fail**: Provide apologetic fallback message

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Alternative search strategies
- Cached result fallback when available

## Performance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Answer accuracy**: User feedback and validation
- **Response completeness**: Content analysis scores
