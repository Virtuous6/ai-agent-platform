# Tests Directory

## Purpose
Contains all test files and testing utilities for the AI Agent Platform. Focuses on integration testing and real-world scenario validation.

## Testing Strategy
Integration-first approach following project principles:
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Component interaction testing
- Runbook execution testing
- Real service integration testing

## Directory Structure

### `integration/`
End-to-end integration tests:
- Complete user interaction flows
- Multi-agent conversations
- Slack bot integration tests
- Database operation tests

### `unit/`
Component-level unit tests:
- Individual function testing
- Utility function validation
- Configuration loading tests
- Error handling verification

### `runbooks/`
Runbook execution tests:
- Workflow validation
- Step execution testing
- Error condition handling
- Performance benchmarking

### `fixtures/`
Test data and mock objects:
- Sample Slack messages
- Mock user interactions
- Test conversation data
- Dummy configuration files

## Test Patterns

### Async Testing
All tests follow async patterns:
```python
import pytest
import asyncio

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_slack_message_processing():
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

### Mocking Strategy
Selective mocking approach:
- Mock external services (Slack API)
- Use real database for integration tests
- Mock slow or expensive operations
- Preserve business logic testing

### Test Data Management
- Isolated test environments
- Clean database state per test
- Reproducible test scenarios
- Data cleanup automation

## Test Categories

### Smoke Tests
Basic functionality verification:
- Bot startup and connection
- Database connectivity
- Agent initialization
- Configuration loading

### Functionality Tests
Feature-specific testing:
- Message processing accuracy
- Agent routing correctness
- State persistence validation
- Error handling robustness

### Performance Tests
System performance validation:
- Response time benchmarks
- Concurrent user handling
- Memory usage monitoring
- Database performance testing

## Running Tests
Test execution commands:
```bash
# All tests
pytest

# Integration tests only
pytest tests/integration/

# Specific test file
pytest tests/integration/test_slack_bot.py

# With coverage
pytest --cov=slack_interface tests/
```

## Development Notes
- Tests are documentation of expected behavior
- Focus on user-facing functionality
- Include error condition testing
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
