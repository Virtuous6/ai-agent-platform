- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption, vulnerability assessment

## Technical Approach

### Intelligent Domain Classification
The agent automatically classifies requests into technical domains:
```python
class TechnicalDomain(Enum):
    PROGRAMMING = "programming"
    DEBUGGING = "debugging"  
    INFRASTRUCTURE = "infrastructure"
    DEVOPS = "devops"
    DATABASE = "database"
    API_DEVELOPMENT = "api_development"
    SYSTEM_ADMIN = "system_admin"
    PERFORMANCE = "performance"
```

### User Level Adaptation
Automatically assesses user technical level and adapts responses:
- **Beginner**: Detailed explanations with tutorials and basics
- **Intermediate**: Focused solutions with relevant context
- **Advanced**: Concise technical guidance with optimization tips

### LLM Configuration
```python
# Main technical responses - precise but helpful
self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125",
    temperature=0.3,  # Lower temperature for technical precision
    max_tokens=800,   # More tokens for detailed explanations
)

# Tool recommendations - very focused
self.tool_llm = ChatOpenAI(
    temperature=0.2,  # Very focused for tool recommendations
    max_tokens=200,
)
```

## Response Features

### Code Examples & Solutions
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Proper markdown code blocks with language specification
- **Complete Examples**: Runnable code snippets with explanations
- **Before/After**: Shows improvements and optimizations
- **Best Practices**: Includes coding standards and patterns

### Step-by-Step Guidance
1. **Problem Analysis**: Identifies root causes beyond symptoms
2. **Solution Design**: Provides clear, actionable instructions
3. **Implementation**: Detailed code examples and configuration
4. **Testing**: Verification and testing recommendations
5. **Optimization**: Performance and security improvements

### Tool Integration Suggestions
Uses dedicated LLM to assess when external tools would enhance responses:
```python
class ToolSuggestion(BaseModel):
    should_use_tool: bool
    recommended_tool: Optional[str]  # web_search, database_query, file_system
    confidence: float
    reasoning: str
```
