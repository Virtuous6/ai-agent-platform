    temperature=0.4,  # Balanced for analytical thinking
    max_tokens=800,   # Comprehensive research responses
)

# Methodology recommendations - structured and focused
self.methodology_llm = ChatOpenAI(
    temperature=0.2,  # Lower temperature for structured methodology
    max_tokens=300,
)
```

## Research Methodology Engine

### Structured Research Recommendations
```python
class ResearchSuggestion(BaseModel):
    research_approach: str          # exploratory, descriptive, explanatory, evaluative
